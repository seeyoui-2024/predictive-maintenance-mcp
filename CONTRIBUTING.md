## Getting Started (All Contributors)

### 1. Find Something to Work On

Browse [**Issues**](https://github.com/LGDiMaggio/predictive-maintenance-mcp/issues) and look for these labels:

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `good first issue` | Small, well-defined tasks perfect for newcomers |
| `help wanted` | Tasks where we specifically need community help |
| `documentation` | Writing, editing, or translating docs |
| `bug` | Something isn't working correctly |
| `enhancement` | New feature or improvement |
| `domain-knowledge` | Requires industrial/engineering expertise, not necessarily code |

**Can't find a matching issue?** [Open a discussion](https://github.com/LGDiMaggio/predictive-maintenance-mcp/discussions) to propose your idea first.

**Before you start:** search the existing
[issues](https://github.com/LGDiMaggio/predictive-maintenance-mcp/issues) and
[discussions](https://github.com/LGDiMaggio/predictive-maintenance-mcp/discussions) —
the problem you're about to solve may already be mapped, in progress, or
explained. The guides in `docs/` (quickstarts, tool catalog, adapter guide,
deployment, benchmark methodology) are the fastest way to pick up the
project's conventions in the area you're touching.

### 2. Claim the Issue

Comment on the issue: *"I'd like to work on this!"* — this prevents duplicate effort.

### 3. Set Up Your Environment

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/predictive-maintenance-mcp.git
cd predictive-maintenance-mcp

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/LGDiMaggio/predictive-maintenance-mcp.git

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
source .venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux

# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Verify everything works
pytest -v
```

### 4. Working in a git worktree

If you use `git worktree` (Claude Code creates one per agent session under
`.claude/worktrees/`), read this before you trust a test run.

`pip install -e .` writes an import finder that hardcodes **one absolute
path**: the checkout that ran the install. Reuse that virtualenv from a second
worktree and `import predictive_maintenance_mcp` still resolves to the *first*
checkout. Your tests then pass or fail for reasons that have nothing to do with
the code in front of you — silently. This has cost four separate sessions real
time; the usual tell is a `__version__` or tool count matching no file you can
see.

**Running the test suite: nothing to do.** `tests/conftest.py` binds the
package to the tree it lives in and raises at collection if that ever fails, so
`pytest` is correct in every worktree.

Two exceptions, both narrow. `pytest --noconftest` disables the binding along
with everything else in that file. And a test that shells out to a child
interpreter gets no conftest either — those pass `conftest.SUBPROCESS_PIN` into
the child explicitly; a new one that shells out must do the same.

**Running anything else** — the server, a REPL, `validate_server.py` — needs a
real environment for this checkout:

```bash
python scripts/setup-worktree.py
```

It prefers `uv sync --frozen` when `uv` is on PATH and falls back to
`python -m venv` + `pip install -e ".[dev]"`, then verifies that the package
imports from this checkout. Budget ~500 MB and ~18k files per worktree; on a
OneDrive- or Dropbox-synced tree that sync cost is why it is a deliberate
command rather than something automatic.

Two things to know before running it. It refuses in the **primary** checkout
unless you pass `--primary`: there `.venv` is the environment every worktree
shares, and `uv sync` prunes to base+dev, which would silently uninstall the
optional extras the suite's `skipif` gates depend on — turning PDF coverage
off everywhere without failing anything. And the `uv` path installs from
`uv.lock`, which is not what CI resolves (`pip install -e ".[dev]"`); use
`--no-uv` when you are reproducing a CI result.

To check by hand at any time:

```bash
python -c "import predictive_maintenance_mcp as p; print(p.__file__)"
```

The printed path must sit under the worktree you are standing in — **once you
have run `setup-worktree.py` there**. Before that it will print the primary
checkout's path, which is expected: the script is opt-in, and `pytest` does not
need it.

## Path 1: Domain Expert (No Coding Required)

Your industrial experience is **irreplaceable**. Here's how to contribute without writing a single line of code:

### Validate Diagnostic Results

Run the server with the included test data and verify:
- Do the bearing fault frequencies make engineering sense?
- Are the ISO 20816-3 zone classifications correct for the given vibration levels?
- Would the envelope analysis results lead to the right maintenance decision?

**How to provide feedback**: Open an issue titled *"Validation: [what you tested]"* and describe what you found. Include screenshots of the HTML reports if helpful.

### Provide Real-World Datasets

We need anonymized vibration data from real machinery:
- Healthy baseline signals for different machine types
- Known fault conditions (bearing, gear, imbalance, misalignment)
- Metadata: sampling rate, shaft speed, bearing type, fault description

**Format**: CSV with one column of acceleration values + a JSON metadata file. See `data/signals/real_train/` for examples.

**Privacy**: Anonymize all data. Remove any proprietary machine identifiers, company names, or location information.

### Suggest New Diagnostic Workflows

You know what matters in the field. Open a discussion or issue describing:
- What diagnostic procedure do you follow daily?
- What information do you need that the current tools don't provide?
- What standards or guidelines should we support (VDI 3832, ISO 20816, etc.)?

### Review the Bearing Catalog

The file `resources/bearing_catalogs/common_bearings_catalog.json` contains a small set of bearings whose geometry is traceable to a public source — every entry carries a mandatory `source` citation, and `tests/test_bearing_catalog_validation.py` enforces physical validity. You can:
- Verify the geometry data against the cited sources
- Suggest additional bearing models **with a verifiable public source** (manufacturer datasheet, dataset documentation, or peer-reviewed paper)
- Provide corrections for contact angles, ball counts, or pitch diameters (with source)

This is a JSON file — you can edit it directly or provide the data in any format and we'll add it.

### How to Create a New MCP Tool

See the complete template in the [Developer Quickstart](docs/QUICKSTART_DEVELOPER.md#step-4-create-your-first-tool).

Summary:
1. Add a module-level tool function in the relevant `src/mcp_tools/*.py` module and register it in that module's `register()`
2. Write comprehensive docstring (the LLM reads this!)
3. Add tests in `tests/`
4. Update `EXAMPLES.md` if the tool adds a new workflow
5. Submit PR

### Write an Adapter

The server loads headerless raw binary files (`.bin`/`.raw`/`.dat`) through an **explicit decode declaration** — it ships no vendor parsers and infers nothing from file content or names. An adapter is any script that translates a vendor's or DAQ's metadata into that declaration, typically by emitting companion `<stem>_metadata.json` files next to the signal files. There is no plugin API and nothing to register: adapters run outside the server, in any language.

The full contract — declaration parameters, companion file schema, merge precedence, and a worked example — is in the [Adapter Guide](docs/ADAPTER_GUIDE.md).

### Architecture Contributions

For bigger features, **open a discussion first** to align on approach:

- **Docker containerization** — Package everything into `docker run predictive-maintenance-mcp`
- **Vector search** — ChromaDB/FAISS for semantic search over large equipment manuals
- **Streaming support** — Real-time vibration signal monitoring via Server-Sent Events
- **Plugin system** — Allow external Python packages to register tools

## Path 3: Technical Writer / Translator

### Documentation Improvements

| Task | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Add a **video walkthrough** of the engineer quickstart | Reduces barrier for non-technical users |
| Write a **case study** using real (anonymized) data | Shows the tool's value to decision-makers |
| Improve **inline code comments** in `src/mcp_tools/` | Helps new developers understand the codebase |
| **Translate** the engineer quickstart to other languages | Expands reach globally |
| Create a **glossary** of vibration analysis terms used in the project | Bridges the gap between domains |

### Documentation Standards

- Use clear, simple language. Assume the reader may not be a native English speaker.
- Include the **"why"** alongside the **"how"** — people remember reasons better than steps.
- Every code example should be copy-pasteable and testable.
- Use screenshots or diagrams for visual concepts (reports, architecture).

## Path 4: Tester / QA

### What to Test

| Test Category | What to Try | Why It Matters |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Edge cases** | Very short signals (10 samples), very long signals (10M+), zero values, NaN values | Robustness |
| **Format variations** | CSV with headers, without headers, different delimiters, numeric formats | Real-world data is messy |
| **Cross-platform** | Run all tests on Windows, macOS, and Linux | Consistent experience |
| **Integration** | Full workflow: load → analyze → report → ML train → predict | End-to-end validation |
| **Ground truth** | Compare results against known reference values from textbooks or certified tools | Accuracy guarantee |
