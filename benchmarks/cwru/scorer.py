"""Scorer: join runner outcomes with fault labels into the results artifact.

This module is the benchmark's SOLE label reader (origin acceptance
example AE3): downloader, importer, and runner parse only the ops view,
while the scorer joins the runner's outcomes with ``labels.json``
through :func:`benchmarks.cwru.records.label_view` and emits
``results.json`` — the single source of truth every published number
must trace to (AE4).

Hit criterion (the methodology's operational core, applied IDENTICALLY
to detection on faulted records and to false-positive counting on the
normal baselines — the symmetry is load-bearing for credibility):

- A fault hits on a record when its check has ``detected == True`` AND
  ``evidence_strength`` in ``{"high", "moderate"}`` (the analyzer's
  vocabulary is high/moderate/low/none; a detected fundamental is never
  rated below moderate).
- BSF (ball) ONLY additionally hits when harmonic 2 is present in the
  BSF check's ``harmonics_detected`` — an entry whose ``"harmonic"``
  field equals 2. CWRU's published "rolling element" factor (4.7135) is
  2xBSF, and the analyzer caps harmonic-only findings at
  ``detected=False`` / evidence ``"low"``, so this leg must read the
  raw per-fault fields. No other fault gets a harmonic leg.

Classification ranking (the scorer computes its own record-level
ranking from the raw per-fault fields; it never consumes the analyzer's
``most_likely``, which structurally cannot name BSF on 2x-only
evidence): among the faults meeting the hit criterion, rank by

1. evidence tier — ``high`` (3) > ``moderate`` (2) > harmonic-only (1);
2. fundamental peak ``magnitude``, descending (a harmonic-only hit uses
   the 2x harmonic entry's magnitude; a missing magnitude sorts last);
3. absolute ``deviation_pct``, ascending (missing sorts last);
4. fixed BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF order as the final deterministic
   tie-break.

Classification is correct when the ranked-first fault maps to the label
(``inner_race`` -> BPFI, ``ball`` -> BSF, ``outer_race`` -> BPFO — the
outer-race position does not change the frequency); a normal record is
correct when NO fault meets the criterion. End-to-end is the
record-level verdict (fault present + type) from the same fields —
numerically the classification metric, reported under both names per
stratum, as the plan requires.

Stratification: Smith & Randall 2015 grades Y1/Y2 (expected detectable
— the ONLY strata feeding the headline aggregate), P1/P2 (partial),
N1/N2 (known-hard, reported separately, NEVER in headline accuracy),
plus ``"ungraded"`` for records whose grade is not yet transcribed.
Records with documented ``known_anomalies`` get their own reported
line, flagged, never excluded from their stratum.

Fail closed: empty outcomes, an empty label view, a missing or extra
opaque id, or any non-``"ok"`` outcome refuses with the offending ids
named — a partial or degenerate input must never masquerade as a score
(never a 100%/0% report). Counts are always published alongside rates;
a rate over zero records is ``None``, never a fabricated percentage.
