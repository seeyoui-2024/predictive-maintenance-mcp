## Why This Project Matters (For Developers)

### The Problem

Industrial machines generate **terabytes of sensor data** — vibration, temperature, pressure, acoustics. Expert analysts can interpret this data to predict failures before they happen, saving thousands of euros per avoided downtime. But these experts are rare and expensive.

### The Insight

LLMs are excellent at **reasoning, planning, and communicating** — but they don't know signal processing. Signal processing libraries (NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn) are excellent at **computation** — but they can't reason or communicate.

### The Solution: MCP

The **Model Context Protocol** is the bridge. It's an open standard (by Anthropic) that defines how an LLM can discover and invoke external tools. Think of it as a universal plugin system:

```
┌─────────────┐     MCP Protocol      ┌──────────────────┐
│             │ ◄──────────────────── │                  │
│    LLM      │   "What tools exist?" │   MCP Server     │
│  (Claude)   │ ────────────────────► │  (This project)  │
│             │   "Call analyze_fft"  │                  │
│             │ ◄──────────────────── │  • analyze_fft   │
│             │   {peaks: [...]}     │  • envelope      │
│             │                      │  • iso_20816     │
│             │                      │  • ml_anomaly    │
└─────────────┘                      └──────────────────┘
```

**The LLM has no idea what FFT is.** It just knows:
- *"There's a tool called `analyze_fft`"*
- *"It takes a file path and sampling rate"*
- *"It returns peaks and frequencies"*

This is **the same pattern** you can use for any domain: medical imaging, financial analysis, climate modeling, robotics. This project is a production-quality reference implementation for the **predictive maintenance** domain.

## Step 1: Set Up the Development Environment

```bash
# Clone and install with dev dependencies
git clone https://github.com/LGDiMaggio/predictive-maintenance-mcp.git
cd predictive-maintenance-mcp
python -m venv .venv

# Activate
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
source .venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux

# Install (includes pytest, black, mypy, flake8)
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Verify everything works
python validate_server.py
pytest -v
```

> **Using a git worktree?** A virtualenv installed with `pip install -e .` stays
> bound to the checkout that installed it, so a second worktree sharing it
> imports the *first* checkout's source — silently. `pytest` is protected
> (`tests/conftest.py` pins the package to its own tree), but running the server
> or `validate_server.py` from a worktree needs its own environment:
> `python scripts/setup-worktree.py`. See
> [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#4-working-in-a-git-worktree).

```

### The Core: `server.py` + `mcp_tools/`

`src/server.py` creates the MCPServer instance and delegates registration to
`src/mcp_tools/` (one module per ISO 13374 block). Each tool is a plain
module-level function, registered by reference:

```python
# src/mcp_tools/analysis_tools.py
async def analyze_fft(ctx, filename: str, sampling_rate: float | None = None, ...):
    """FFT spectrum analysis with automatic peak detection."""
    # ... performs actual signal processing
    # ... returns structured results

def register(mcp):
    mcp.tool()(analyze_fft)
```

**That's it.** A module-level Python function + one `mcp.tool()(fn)` line in
`register()` = an LLM-accessible tool that is also directly importable in tests.

### Resources vs Tools

| Concept | Purpose | Example | When to Use |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Resource** | Read-only data access | `signal://list` | LLM needs to browse/read data |
| **Tool** | Computation & side effects | `analyze_fft()` | LLM needs to compute something |

Resources are like GET endpoints. Tools are like POST endpoints. The LLM uses Resources to gather context and Tools to take action.

---

## Step 3: Inspect the Server Interactively

### Using MCP Inspector

The best way to understand the server is to see it live:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx predictive-maintenance-mcp
```

Or from source:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run predictive-maintenance-mcp
```

This opens a web UI where you can:
- Browse all registered Resources and Tools
- See each tool's parameters, types, and documentation
- Call tools with test data and see the results
- Understand exactly what the LLM sees

### Using Claude Desktop

Configure the server in Claude Desktop ([see INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md)) and try:

```
What tools do you have available for vibration analysis?
```

Claude will describe every tool, its parameters, and what it does — because MCP exposes this metadata automatically.

---

## Step 4: Create Your First Tool

Let's add a new tool: **thermographic analysis** (simplified example). This demonstrates the pattern for any new diagnostic capability.

### 4.1 — Write the Tool Function

Add to the relevant `src/mcp_tools/*.py` module (e.g. `analysis_tools.py`)
and register it in that module's `register()`:

```python
def analyze_temperature_trend(
    temperatures: list[float],
    timestamps: list[str],
    warning_threshold: float = 80.0,
    critical_threshold: float = 100.0
) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze temperature trend data for thermal anomalies.
    
    Detects overheating patterns, calculates rate of change,
    and classifies severity based on configurable thresholds.
    
    Args:
        temperatures: List of temperature readings in °C
        timestamps: List of ISO timestamps for each reading
        warning_threshold: Warning temperature in °C (default: 80.0)
        critical_threshold: Critical temperature in °C (default: 100.0)
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary with trend analysis, anomaly detection, and severity
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    temps = np.array(temperatures)
    
    # Calculate statistics
    current = temps[-1]
    rate_of_change = np.gradient(temps).mean()  # °C per sample
    
    # Classify severity
    if current >= critical_threshold:
        severity = "CRITICAL"
        recommendation = "Immediate shutdown recommended"
    elif current >= warning_threshold:
        severity = "WARNING"
        recommendation = "Schedule inspection within 24 hours"
    else:
        severity = "NORMAL"
        recommendation = "No action required"
    
    return {
        "current_temperature": float(current),
        "max_temperature": float(temps.max()),
        "min_temperature": float(temps.min()),
        "mean_temperature": float(temps.mean()),
        "rate_of_change": float(rate_of_change),
        "severity": severity,
        "recommendation": recommendation,
        "samples_analyzed": len(temps)
    }
```

### 4.2 — Write Tests

Create `tests/test_temperature.py`:

```python
import pytest

def test_analyze_temperature_normal():
    """Test normal temperature classification."""
    from predictive_maintenance_mcp.mcp_tools.analysis_tools import (
        analyze_temperature_trend,
    )
    
    result = analyze_temperature_trend(
        temperatures=[45.0, 46.0, 45.5, 46.2, 45.8],
        timestamps=["2025-01-01T00:00", "2025-01-01T01:00", 
                     "2025-01-01T02:00", "2025-01-01T03:00", 
                     "2025-01-01T04:00"]
    )
    
    assert result["severity"] == "NORMAL"
    assert result["current_temperature"] == pytest.approx(45.8)

def test_analyze_temperature_critical():
    """Test critical temperature detection."""
    from predictive_maintenance_mcp.mcp_tools.analysis_tools import (
        analyze_temperature_trend,
    )
    
    result = analyze_temperature_trend(
        temperatures=[60.0, 75.0, 90.0, 105.0, 110.0],
        timestamps=["2025-01-01T00:00", "2025-01-01T01:00",
                     "2025-01-01T02:00", "2025-01-01T03:00",
                     "2025-01-01T04:00"]
    )
    
    assert result["severity"] == "CRITICAL"
    assert "shutdown" in result["recommendation"].lower()
```

### 4.3 — Run Tests

```bash
pytest tests/test_temperature.py -v
```

### 4.4 — Test with Claude

Restart Claude Desktop and try:

```
I have these temperature readings from a pump motor: 
45, 52, 61, 73, 85, 92, 98, 103 °C 
taken hourly. Analyze the trend.
```

Claude will automatically discover and call your new tool.

**That's it.** You just extended an industrial AI system with a new diagnostic capability.

## Step 5: Understand the Codebase

### Key Patterns to Study

| Pattern | Where | What You'll Learn |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| **Tool with auto-detection** | `analyze_fft()` | How to load metadata and infer parameters |
| **Report generation** | `generate_fft_report()` | How to create interactive Plotly HTML reports |
| **ML pipeline** | `train_anomaly_model()` | How to build scikit-learn pipelines as MCP tools |
| **Caching** | `extract_manual_specs()` | How to cache expensive operations (PDF parsing) |
| **Resource + Tool combo** | `signal://read` + `analyze_fft` | How Resources and Tools work together |

### Design Principles

1. **One thin orchestrator, one module per block** — `server.py` only creates the MCPServer instance; every tool lives as an importable module-level function in `src/mcp_tools/`. This makes tools easy to understand, test, and deploy.

2. **Tools are pure functions** — Each tool takes parameters, does computation, returns structured data. No side effects except file I/O (reports, models).

3. **Metadata-driven** — Sampling rates, bearing frequencies, signal units are auto-detected from metadata JSON files. No hardcoded assumptions.

4. **Fail gracefully** — Tools return meaningful error messages, not stack traces. The LLM can relay these to the user in natural language.
