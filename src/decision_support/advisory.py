"""ISO 13374 Block 6 — server-authored advisory.

Every evaluative sentence a report shows a human is written *here*, by the
server that computed the numbers. Renderers place these strings; they never
compose their own.

This exists because the previous arrangement let the caller author report
content (see ``generate_diagnostic_report_docx``'s ``sections`` argument).
When the caller is a language model, the numbers survive the trip and the
labels do not: a superseded standard name, a machine-class vocabulary this
codebase does not use, and a "confidence" grade that
:mod:`..decision_support.recommendations` deliberately refuses to produce.

Three rules hold throughout:

1. Standard names, zone descriptions, and threshold provenance are read from
   :mod:`..diagnostics.iso20816` — the single source of that vocabulary — and
   never re-typed here.
2. No field, value, or sentence is a confidence or a probability. Evidential
   weight is conveyed by naming the facts that support a finding, and the
   categorical ``evidence_strength`` always travels with a sentence saying
   what it counts.
3. A missing input produces an authored statement about the absence and the
   conclusion it makes unavailable. It never produces a missing section — a
   silently absent block reads as "nothing to report".
