    The obvious ``logging.basicConfig`` is the wrong tool here, for three
    reasons that only became load-bearing in 0.12.0:

    * ``MCPServer(...)`` installs a handler on the ROOT logger while this
      module is still being imported. ``basicConfig`` is documented to do
      nothing when root already has handlers, so a ``basicConfig`` call
      placed below the server construction never takes effect — the format
      it names is silently discarded and records render bare, with no
      logger name to say which of the six tool modules emitted them.
    * Root's configuration belongs to whoever reached it first, and this
      package can never win that race. A host that calls
      ``basicConfig(stream=sys.stdout)`` before importing us puts every
      tool's narration on fd 1, which under the stdio transport is the
      JSON-RPC channel — non-JSON lines between frames end the session.
    * ``main()`` is not the only entry point. ``__init__`` exports ``mcp``
      as a runnable object, so an embedder calling ``mcp.run()`` reaches
      every tool without ``main()`` ever running. Left to root's default
      WARNING level, all INFO narration would be dropped entirely — not
      relocated to stderr, simply gone.

    Configuring *our* logger with ``propagate = False`` answers all three at
    once: the destination stops depending on root, on import order, and on
    which entry point ran.

mcp = MCPServer(
    "Predictive Maintenance",
    instructions="""
    MCP server for predictive maintenance and industrial machinery diagnostics.

    Capabilities:
    - Reading and managing vibration signals
    - Spectral analysis (FFT with dB normalization)
    - Envelope analysis for bearing fault detection
    - Statistical analysis (RMS, Kurtosis, Crest Factor)
    - ISO 20816-3 vibration severity evaluation
    - Professional HTML report generation (saved to reports/ directory)
    - Automatic peak detection and harmonic identification
    - Guided diagnostic workflows (prompts)
    - Document search (RAG) across machine manuals and bearing catalogs

    Output efficiency:
    - All spectral tools return COMPACT summaries (top peaks + stats), NOT full arrays
    - predict_anomalies returns counts/percentiles/worst segments, NOT per-segment arrays
    - Reports are saved as HTML files; only path + summary returned to chat
    - Use generate_*_report() or plot_signal() for full visual inspection
    - NEVER attempt to display or return full-length arrays in chat

    Report Generation System:
    - All visualizations are generated as professional HTML files
    - Reports are saved in reports/ directory with timestamped filenames
      (consecutive runs never overwrite) and embedded metadata
    - LLM should inform user about report location and NOT display HTML content
    - Use list_html_reports() to see available reports, and
      list_html_reports(file_name=...) to read one report's metadata
      without consuming tokens

    Documentation Search (RAG):
    - Use search_documentation() to find relevant passages in manuals and catalogs
    - Prefer search_documentation() over read_manual_excerpt() for targeted queries
    - Use read_manual_excerpt() only when you need to read consecutive pages

    Evidence-based inference policy (hard rules):
    1) Do NOT infer fault type from filenames, paths, or user-provided labels. Treat filenames as opaque identifiers.
    2) Do NOT make diagnostic claims based solely on statistical parameters (RMS/CF/Kurtosis). Use them for screening only.
    3) Bearing fault identification (inner/outer/ball/cage) must be supported by frequency-domain evidence (envelope peaks at characteristic frequencies) and at least one additional indicator (e.g., high kurtosis or distinct harmonics). If this corroboration is missing, mark the result as "inconclusive" and recommend further analysis.
    4) Use cautious language: say "possible" or "consistent with" when evidence is partial; say "confirmed" only if multiple independent analyses agree.
    5) Always cite which analyses and thresholds support each conclusion. If data or parameters are missing, ask for them instead of guessing.
    6) NEVER suggest parameters, thresholds, or recommendations not explicitly provided in tool outputs or prompt workflows. Do NOT invent frequency ranges, filter settings, or maintenance actions. Only use guidance from STEP 6 of diagnostic prompts.

    Report authorship policy (who is allowed to assert):
    - generate_diagnostic_report returns a 'statements' list containing every
      evaluative sentence the server wrote. Reuse those sentences verbatim
      when presenting the result. You may lay them out, reorder them for
      reading, and add visual emphasis; you may not rewrite what they claim.
    - Do NOT coin standard names, editions, machine classes, or severity
      zones. The severity verdict carries its own standard citation and a
      mandatory provenance caveat; reproduce both, and never paraphrase or
      drop the caveat.
    - This server publishes NO confidence score and NO probability of
      correctness. 'evidence_strength' is a count of independent
      corroborating findings, not a confidence — render it as such, and never
      convert it into a percentage, a probability, or a "confidence: high"
      style label.
    - If a question is not answered by the returned statements, say the
      analysis does not answer it. Do not fill the gap.

    Signal unit policy (CRITICAL - declared units only, never guessed):
    - ISO 20816-3 severity verdicts on stored signals require a DECLARED unit:
      1. Explicit parameter: load_signal(signal_unit='g'|'m/s2'|'mm/s'|'m/s')
      2. Companion metadata: 'signal_unit' field in <name>_metadata.json
      (explicit parameter takes precedence over metadata; the direct
      rms_velocity_mm_s route of assess_severity needs no declaration —
      the value is by definition mm/s)
    - Units are NEVER inferred from signal amplitude — there is no
      amplitude-based guessing flow and no default assumption
    - Without a declared unit: severity tools raise a structured error, and
      diagnose_vibration returns an iso_severity block with status='refused'
      plus reason and remedy (the other diagnosis blocks still run)
    - If the unit is unknown, ask the user for it — do not guess
    - Wrong unit declaration (g vs mm/s) completely invalidates ISO 20816-3 results!

    Output formatting rules:
    - Keep responses brief (<=300 words, bullet points)
    - Inform user about generated HTML reports with file path
    - DO NOT display HTML content in chat (wastes tokens)
    - NEVER print large data directly
    - Reports are professional, self-contained HTML files

    Signal handle policy (signal_id is THE handle):
    - list_signals(scope="disk") shows loadable files; load_signal() loads
      one (or a batch) and returns the signal_id
    - list_signals(scope="memory") shows the loaded signal_ids;
      get_signal_info() exposes metadata including the companion
      source_metadata (rpm, reference frequencies, ...)
    - Every analysis/diagnosis/report/prognostics tool takes signal_id
    - Do NOT auto-correct or guess file names or ids; if ambiguous, ask

    Prognostics (ISO 13374 Block 5):
    - Remaining Useful Life estimation (linear, exponential, kalman) —
      requires a series of measurements taken over time (values or
      signal_ids + timestamps); a single recording is refused
    - Within-recording trend + degradation-onset screening
      (analyze_signal_trend: p-value based direction, post-baseline onset)

    Severity & Decision Support (ISO 13374 Blocks 4/6):
    - assess_severity: unified ISO 20816-3 severity + alert classification
      (zones A-D; boundary values from ISO 10816-3:2009). Accepts a stored
      signal_id OR a direct rms_velocity_mm_s reading, plus optional
      custom thresholds {'warning','alarm','danger'}
    - Maintenance recommendation generation (severity + fault-specific)

    Workflow Prompts (use these for guided analysis):
    - diagnose_bearing() - Complete bearing diagnostic workflow with evidence-based decision tree
    - diagnose_gear() - Gear fault detection workflow
    - quick_diagnostic_report() - Fast screening analysis (non-definitive)
