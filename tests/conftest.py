# Import provenance: test the tree these tests live in, not some other one.
#
# `pip install -e .` writes a MetaPathFinder whose MAPPING hardcodes ONE
# absolute path -- the checkout that ran the install. Every git worktree
# sharing that venv therefore imports `predictive_maintenance_mcp` from the
# primary checkout, and the suite silently exercises source the author never
# edited. This has cost four separate sessions real time; the tell was
# nonsense like a tool count or a __version__ that matched no file on disk.
#
# It cannot be fixed by putting src/ on sys.path. The package is imported by
# its installed name, and there is no directory literally named
# `predictive_maintenance_mcp` in this tree -- pyproject maps the name onto
# src/ via [tool.setuptools.package-dir]. (A `sys.path.insert(0, src)` line
# lived here for exactly that reason and did nothing: nothing bare-imports
# `server`, and every intra-src import is relative.)
#
# So bind the name to THIS tree explicitly. setuptools appends its finder to
# sys.meta_path, i.e. behind PathFinder; inserting at position 0 puts this
# one ahead of both. Sub-packages resolve through the parent's __path__ and
# need no special handling.
#
# In CI and in the primary checkout the editable install already points here,
# so this resolves to the same files and changes nothing. It only diverges
# where today's behaviour is wrong.
