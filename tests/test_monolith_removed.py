"""U7 CI guard: the legacy monolith and root shims must never reappear.

Replaces ``test_obsolete_tools_removed.py``: instead of asserting which
functions the monolith no longer exposes, it asserts the monolith itself
(and every root-level compatibility shim) is gone — from the filesystem,
from imports, and from operational documentation.

The needle strings are built by concatenation so this guard never matches
itself in a repo-wide grep.
